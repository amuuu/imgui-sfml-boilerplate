# ImGui SFML Boilerplate
This is a boilerplate project that combines the 3 repos of [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), [ImGui-SFML](https://github.com/eliasdaler/imgui-sfml), and [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

ImGui and ImGui-SFML are added as submodules so you have to clone with submodules if you want to use this repo.
